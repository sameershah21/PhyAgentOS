# Heartbeat Tasks

This file is checked every 30 minutes by your PhyAgentOS agent.
Add tasks below that you want the agent to work on periodically.

If this file has no tasks (only headers and comments), the agent will skip the heartbeat.

## Active Tasks

<!-- Add your periodic tasks below this line -->

- [ ] Read ENVIRONMENT.md and check if any objects have changed state. If something notable happened (e.g., an object fell, moved, or disappeared), proactively report to the user.
- [ ] Read ACTION.md — if it is non-empty and has been pending for more than 5 minutes, warn the user that the hardware watchdog may not be running.

## Completed
